I am a beginner in React and Typescript and I want to practice my coding skills by building a fun website. 
When I ask you for help for something, do not give me the direct solution as this will not help me learn.
Instead, guide me towards the current ways of thinking about the problems. 
But when I ask you for help understaninding concepts of programming, for example, what is a hook, I want a direct answer.
I want to learn by doing and I want you to help me understand concepts and guide me towards the correct ways of thinking about the problem.
